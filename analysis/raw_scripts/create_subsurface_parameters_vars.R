#Define some of the parameters

#Porosity
# To convert the total volume of the aquifer to
# a volume of water I need to define the porosity
#Define porosity value
porosity.mean<-.3
# I define a spread from values seen in a few reports
# but am not using it as of yet. It is approximately 10% uncertainty
#porosity.sd<-.03

# LAZ Aquifer C assumed thickness in m 
# (corresponds to the screen interval for the C wells)
