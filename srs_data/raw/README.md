  - Files ending in (C)4R.csv are dumps of tables from the analysis database used to do data munging from the original BEIDMS database which is the source of the data. The "C" means the data corresponds to the wells sampling the Lower Aquifer Zone (LAZ) of the Upper Three Run Aquifer, whereas the ones without refer to the wells sampling the Upper Aquifer Zone (UAZ).
  - allstationsd3.csv lists all the stations of interest inside the following polygon : POLYGON((-81.69959850412471 33.25157883545753,-81.66893076363978 33.27075529497145,-81.66874375846673 33.2797255736357,-81.69341116073315 33.28833045113768,-81.69959850412471 33.25157883545753))
